# myblogs Secure

A secure Flutter application powered Liferay DXP.

## Getting Started

This is an example application secured by Liferay login using OAuth2 standard.

It uses liferay_oauth flutter package created by Xtivia Developers to simplify the login needs. 

OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard authorization protocol. Users can seamlessly share select credentials from another website/Mobile App to log into yours. It works by authorizing password-less access to portions of user-owned resources (such as an email address, a user profile picture, or something else from your account) and other permissioned resources.

Ensure the liferay_oauth package is pointing to the right folder in your pubspec.yaml:

```dependencies:
    flutter:
        sdk: flutter
    liferay_oauth:
        path: /Users/chetanchadalavada/Desktop/MobileProject/flutter/liferay_oauth
```
